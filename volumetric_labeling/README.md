This folder contains matlab code for generating volumetric labels from manual traces uing topology preserving fast marching algorithm.

Script `test_soma_threshold.m` is used to find optimal soma intensity threshold for given image stack.

Script `generate_label.m` is used to generate a volumetric label from manual neuron trace and image stack.
